# Ported Apex Legends Entities
Models I've port(ed/ing) from Apex Legends to [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/). The goal is, once all models are ported, to upload the models in a pack to the Steam Workshop and then upload each entity individually to the Workshop 

## Prerequisites
None.

## Manual Installation

Unzip the contents such that the ```lua```, ```materials```, etc. files are inside of a parent folder.

Take this parent folder and move it into the Garry's Mod ```addons``` directory.

The default directory is located at ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons```

Example: The ```resources``` folder is structured like so ```..\addons\ported-apex-legends-entities\resources```
